## Problem Statement
The dataset contains demographic details of credit card customer as well as details of their credit card usage for the past 6 months. The problem definition is to build a classification model that predicts whether or not a customer will default their credir card the following month.

## Code
The Exploratory Data Analysis for the datatset was done on Tableau. This is the [Tableau Workbook](Business_tableau_final.twbx).
